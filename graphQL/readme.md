# GraphQl 


There's a very cool GraphQL explorer, to access it go to this URL 


```
https://app.hubspot.com/graphiql/<portalId>

``` 


## Before using grapQL with HubSpot 

It's important to have a private app token with the graphQL scope enabled see : https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/cms/data/query-hubspot-data-using-graphql#scope-requirements
